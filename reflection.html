                    The only thing that went well about the group work for me was having at least one other dependable teammate &ndash; Dung, 
                    and that we were both able to quickly split the load of the assignment between us and work on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I could&rsquo;ve been much more communicative and vocal to help Dung in communicating with the other members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most surprising part of this was finding out we had to work on everything even though we were one member short, 
                    I had doubted that we would be able to finish everything on time and in an adequate manner. 
                    I was proven wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal big take-away from this has been that not everyone in your group will have the motivation and commitment to properly work with you on the tasks at hand, 
                    but there can always be the rare few who will help you see it through to the end, and that those people should never be taken for granted. 
                    I&rsquo;ve also learned that I lack good communication skills and the patience you would need to work in a group.
