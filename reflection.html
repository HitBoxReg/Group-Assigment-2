                    The only thing that went well about the group work for me was having at least one other dependable teammate &ndash; Dung, 
                    and that we were both able to quickly split the load of the assignment between us and work on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I could&rsquo;ve been much more communicative and vocal to help Dung in communicating with the other members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most surprising part of this was finding out we had to work on everything even though we were one member short, 
                    I had doubted that we would be able to finish everything on time and in an adequate manner. 
                    I was proven wrong.
                </p>

                    My personal big take-away from this has been that not everyone in your group will have the motivation and commitment to properly work with you on the tasks at hand, 
                    but there can always be the rare few who will help you see it through to the end, and that those people should never be taken for granted. 
                    I&rsquo;ve also learned that I lack good communication skills and the patience you would need to work in a group.

                As a member of group 6, I can tell that I am happy about this at week 8 because the project process went well recently and every team member has received and finished their work equally.
                We have contacted each other easily via Facebook messenger from the beginning of the project. So that, we have set up many meeting between group members frequently.
                But there was one thing that made me quite unpleasant is the quality of the meetings we have.
                The meeting sometimes did not go on the right direction because we did not prepare enough as otherâ€™s expectations due to the lack of knowledge when we are still freshman in university.
                Furthermore, missing one guy from the group project made me feel shocking and surprising at first, but I and my team talked to the lecturer then found the solution that we have to do as a 3-member group.
                From that, I gained a lot of valuable experience about responsibilities when working in a group and do not make another member take what they do not deserve.
                So, I carefully did my tasks by my best and give everyone motivation by finishing my task as soon as I could.
                Moreover, GitHub is the very first thing that I experienced in IT environment, when I started using it, it created a lot of confusions but after getting instructions from lecturers and group members I get used to it and found out how useful it is for teamwork because team member need not to meet but they can contribute their work by pushing and pulling functions and I have learnt creating a HTML website that I used to think it difficult.
