                    Dung: The most helpful and dependable member in the group, 
                    any section he picks up he finishes and is also closest to being the team leader, 
                    he reaches out to other members to organize meetings/divide the assignment and asks our lecturer on behalf of the team on parts we have trouble understanding.

                    Huy: Probably the least helpful member of the group, it took Huy 4 weeks to finish the part he was given on our first meeting 
                    (one of the 4 1200 word reports). 
                    On one of the meetings, when we were discussing the date and location of the meetup, Huy replied to the date, but disappeared when we were discussing locations. 
                    On the day of the meetup, 45 mins before the meeting was to take place, he replied saying he doesn&rsquo;t want to meet at where both me and Dung agreed on meeting, 
                    and forced us to meet on campus (very far away from where all 3 of us live). 
                    During this meeting, which was a week away from the deadline, he showed up with excuses on why he couldn&rsquo;t show us his report. 
                    A couple of days prior to this happening, he took a screenshot of a small part of his report to reply to us asking for his progress, 
                    to which we found out was heavily plagiarized and had to discuss this with him on the next meeting, asking him to fix the report (which has already taken 4 weeks). 
                    He did manage to finish his report, but 3 days before the assignment deadline, at which point all other parts of the assignment had been picked up by either me or Dung. 
                    During the course of this assignment, Huy was constantly avoiding, and not replying to messages in our group chat asking for clarification on certain things 
                    (like his progress on his report, or asking him to send us the word document of his report).
                </p>

                    Anh: This member did now show up or reply in any way to us trying to reach him.
                </p>

                    Khoi: I find myself having difficulty assessing my performance for this assignment, 
                    Dung and I picked up after each other from whatever parts still needed to be done, 
                    whilst our third member was still struggling to barely finish the ONE part he chose for himself. 
                    The most obvious problem about me is that I did not try to reach out to the other members, and my frustration with Huy left Dung to be the only person responsible for communicating with every team member, 
                    so if it wasn&rsquo;t for Dung reaching out and setting up meetings, I doubt we would&rsquo;ve been able to progress as far as we did, 
                    and I could&rsquo;ve been more helpful to Dung in this regard.
                </p>
