            <li>Khoi's feedback:</li>
                <p>
                    Dung: The most helpful and dependable member in the group, 
                    any section he picks up he finishes and is also closest to being the team leader, 
                    he reaches out to other members to organize meetings/divide the assignment and asks our lecturer on behalf of the team on parts we have trouble understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Huy: Probably the least helpful member of the group, it took Huy 4 weeks to finish the part he was given on our first meeting 
                    (one of the 4 1200 word reports). 
                    On one of the meetings, when we were discussing the date and location of the meetup, Huy replied to the date, but disappeared when we were discussing locations. 
                    On the day of the meetup, 45 mins before the meeting was to take place, he replied saying he doesn&rsquo;t want to meet at where both me and Dung agreed on meeting, 
                    and forced us to meet on campus (very far away from where all 3 of us live). 
                    During this meeting, which was a week away from the deadline, he showed up with excuses on why he couldn&rsquo;t show us his report. 
                    A couple of days prior to this happening, he took a screenshot of a small part of his report to reply to us asking for his progress, 
                    to which we found out was heavily plagiarized and had to discuss this with him on the next meeting, asking him to fix the report (which has already taken 4 weeks). 
                    He did manage to finish his report, but 3 days before the assignment deadline, at which point all other parts of the assignment had been picked up by either me or Dung. 
                    During the course of this assignment, Huy was constantly avoiding, and not replying to messages in our group chat asking for clarification on certain things 
                    (like his progress on his report, or asking him to send us the word document of his report).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anh: This member did now show up or reply in any way to us trying to reach him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Khoi: I find myself having difficulty assessing my performance for this assignment, 
                    Dung and I picked up after each other from whatever parts still needed to be done, 
                    whilst our third member was still struggling to barely finish the ONE part he chose for himself. 
                    The most obvious problem about me is that I did not try to reach out to the other members, and my frustration with Huy left Dung to be the only person responsible for communicating with every team member, 
                    so if it wasn&rsquo;t for Dung reaching out and setting up meetings, I doubt we would&rsquo;ve been able to progress as far as we did, 
                    and I could&rsquo;ve been more helpful to Dung in this regard.
                </p>
                <li>Dung's feedback:</li>
                <p>
                    Overall: At week 8, the report progress of my group is almost done except the feedback and group reflection.
                    I could say it was about 80% of total work has been completed.
                    At first, my team was assigned as 4 members, but unfortunately we could not contact to the last member so we had to do it as a 3-member group and I think it was fine because each member volunteered to take some parts of the report.
                    About me, I has worked on IT Industry, IT Work (a whole group went for the interview and I just wrote the part) and Machine Learning in IT Technologies.
                    I see that those is not a big problem to me because there are a lot of data supported, I also got help from my group to do my parts so I think experience was not so bad expect the missing group member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Khoi: Then about Hoang Minh Khoi, he was a good teammate to me during this assignment 2 because he the group member that I worked with the most of time, he and I were the ones who discussed about workload management and time.
                    He also has significant skills of HTML, so that he helped other a lot in designing and editing. He worked almost on Team Profile, Tools, Interview Transcript (he wrote down all the speech of the IT professionals) and Clouds, Services and Servers and Cyber Security in IT Technologies.
                </p>

                    Huy: Next, Mai Le Anh Huy who worked on Robots part in IT Technologies and some of ideas helping other people parts.
                    His workload was the least because he got some trouble about referencing during working on his part, he has fixed it for many times which led to a big delay.
                    Furthermore, communicating with him was difficult so our group did not have a quality discussion on his part and assigned work for him.
                    Finally, I am totally happy about the report because we had a backup plan for any delay and problem so that we are able to finish it on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quang Anh: As I mentioned above that he did not show in any meeting and he only responded once. Therefore, he had no contribution to the project and no responsibility at all.
