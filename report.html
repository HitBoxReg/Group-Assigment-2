        <h2>IT technologies for discussion: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Clouds, Services, servers</strong></li>
            <p>
                Cloud computing has come a long way, what started out as a concept of time-sharing &ndash; 
                the sharing of a computing resource among many users at the same time, 
                has evolved into on-demand delivery of IT resources: <em>computing power; storage; databases; bandwidth, memory, software</em> 
                without the direct management of the user. There are many aspects of cloud computing that are being developed as different products and services. 
                The most notable ones include <strong><em>Data centers</em></strong> (facilities used to house computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems)<em>, 
                <strong>Distributed File Systems</strong></em> (the storing and accessing of files using a client-server architecture)
                <em>, <strong>Distributed Application Frameworks over Clouds.</strong></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most popular data centers on the market is Amazon Web Services with over 55 <em>availability zones (AZ)</em> in more than 18 geographic regions with plants for implementing 12 more <em>AZs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Google File System</em> <em>(GFS),</em> as the name suggests, is a file system designed by Google to provide efficient, reliable access to data using large clusters of commodity servers, 
                this means that compared to other file systems, GFS is optimized to run on data centers with extremely high throughputs of data, low latency and resilience from server failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software frameworks like <em>MapReduce</em> support distributed computing on large data sets on clusters of computers using map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming. 
                The biggest strength of this framework is not aforementioned map and reduce functions but the optimization of the execution engine and the resulting scalability and fault-tolerance.
            </p>
            <p>Cloud computing is mainly used as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Infrastructure as a service</em></strong> (Iaas): Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Providing access to networking features, computers, and data storage space. Similar to existing IT resources.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Platform as a Service</em></strong> (Paas): More emphasis on deployment and management of applications, removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure like capacity planning, software maintenance, etc&hellip;</li>
                <li><strong><em>Software as a Service</em></strong> (SaaS): A complete product, run and managed by a service provider. Mostly end-user applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The future of Cloud computing will not only alter the way we work, but also the way we live. Cloud computing enable businesses to streamline their processes and evidently improve performance in all aspects. 
                Zero-trust enterprise security is also quickly becoming popular, with SARS-CoV-2 still running rampant, by letting users work remotely from any location on Earth. 
                All the while a hosting service is working behind-the-scenes to ensure proper credentials and security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the adaptation of 5g and the constant improvements in electronical manufacturing, <strong><em>ubiquitous computing</em></strong> (embedding computational capability into everyday objects) is not a far-fetched reality where any item can have computational power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud-based education platforms are also quickly gaining ground (another adaptation to SARS-CoV-2), and improvements in global connectivity will only push a <strong><em>globalized education</em></strong> that enables students of all socioeconomic status the same level and access of education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cloud has also become the best environment to develop <strong><em>AIs</em></strong>, where there is an abundance of processing power. But you can only learn so much from yourself, which is why <strong><em>Inference</em></strong> is also integral to creating an AI. 
                This is where our improvements in mobile devices and technology come in - creating a massive inference pool of data for AIs to take what it has learned from the cloud environment and try to apply it to individual use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of the above developments affect many fields from economics, education, and even our daily lives:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Ubiquitous computing:</em></strong> 
                    ubiquitous computing systems are used for the handling of data (collecting, processing, etc&hellip;) with the ability to adapt to the context and activity of said data. 
                    As we are prone to human errors in our decision-making processes, comprehensive data that is available in ubiquitous computing systems allows for better, more productive workflows and processes, 
                    ie. When collecting data on how much water is leaking from a city&rsquo;s water mains, a wireless sensor network can instantaneously relay this information without the need for manual intervention. 
                    Going along with the above example, the number of required water plant workers/maintenance crews may drastically decrease as engineers can easily determine how to adapt to the situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Globalized education:</em></strong> 
                    The globalization of education means the globalization of knowledge. 
                    Discussing the impact of this is akin to discussing the impact of globalization, which has been an ongoing debate ever since globalization was first conceptualized. 
                    In short, cultures around the world will become more democratic, creative and critical, developing interpersonal and prosocial capabilities first as the challenges of environmental sustainability and global development are highly complex and dynamic. 
                    To be more specific, among the first to be impacted will be traditional classroom educational institutions. As online learning becomes more prevalent, schools and its faculties may need to adapt and attract as many local families and students as possible to compete with the flexibility ease of access of online courses, 
                    or perhaps create their own online courses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>AIs:</em></strong> The advantage of running an AI locally, as opposed to on a server environment, is the preservation of user privacy &ndash; 
                    user data does not need to be submitted to the cloud for the AI to function, and increases relative speed of the AI&rsquo;s output. With every new flagship smartphone model, 
                    we see new advances and features built by AIs, taking full use of <strong><em>mobile inference</em></strong>, things like Apples&rsquo;s FaceID and Animoji, Google Assistant and Google Lens, 
                    and Seeing Eye by Microsoft all use AIs powered by mobile devices and cloud technology to push the boundaries of human-computer interactions: <em>Unlocking our devices with a simple glance; 
                    Real time image searches; Support people with visual impairments by providing image recognition features. </em>The effect of this will span across every mobile device user regardless of background and geographic location.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For IT students, there is, without a doubt, going to be a big impact caused by cloud technology on not just their academic progress, but also their eventual career path as well. 
                Cloud technology is already being implemented in many higher-education courses with tools like canvas, github, and google drive being essential to their learning processes. 
                Our daily lives are not without change either, as technology is slowly seeping into every aspect of life itself. 
                Things that we have been doing subconsciously have one way or another changed with the use of technological interconnectivity - 
                pictures that we take are then instantaneously synced and saved on a cloud, using our voice to command devices and control how they do things with voice recognition and cloud-located AIs, to cars having user profiles that access your favorite playlists and radio channels from a server. 
                And the people around us are subject to all of this as well, with their lives also slowly, but surely being brought into the cloud as it expands into every corner of human advancement: smart fridges, smart tvs, and even smart ovens all use, or is connected to, some iteration of internet connectivity and cloud-based technology.
