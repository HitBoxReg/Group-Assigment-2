        <h2>IT technologies for discussion: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Clouds, Services, servers:</strong></li>
            <p>
                Cloud computing has come a long way, what started out as a concept of time-sharing &ndash; 
                the sharing of a computing resource among many users at the same time, 
                has evolved into on-demand delivery of IT resources: <em>computing power; storage; databases; bandwidth, memory, software</em> 
                without the direct management of the user. There are many aspects of cloud computing that are being developed as different products and services. 
                The most notable ones include <strong><em>Data centers</em></strong> (facilities used to house computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems)<em>, 
                <strong>Distributed File Systems</strong></em> (the storing and accessing of files using a client-server architecture)
                <em>, <strong>Distributed Application Frameworks over Clouds.</strong></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most popular data centers on the market is Amazon Web Services with over 55 <em>availability zones (AZ)</em> in more than 18 geographic regions with plants for implementing 12 more <em>AZs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Google File System</em> <em>(GFS),</em> as the name suggests, is a file system designed by Google to provide efficient, reliable access to data using large clusters of commodity servers, 
                this means that compared to other file systems, GFS is optimized to run on data centers with extremely high throughputs of data, low latency and resilience from server failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software frameworks like <em>MapReduce</em> support distributed computing on large data sets on clusters of computers using map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming. 
                The biggest strength of this framework is not aforementioned map and reduce functions but the optimization of the execution engine and the resulting scalability and fault-tolerance.
            </p>
            <p>Cloud computing is mainly used as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Infrastructure as a service</em></strong> (Iaas): Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Providing access to networking features, computers, and data storage space. Similar to existing IT resources.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Platform as a Service</em></strong> (Paas): More emphasis on deployment and management of applications, removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure like capacity planning, software maintenance, etc&hellip;</li>
                <li><strong><em>Software as a Service</em></strong> (SaaS): A complete product, run and managed by a service provider. Mostly end-user applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The future of Cloud computing will not only alter the way we work, but also the way we live. Cloud computing enable businesses to streamline their processes and evidently improve performance in all aspects. 
                Zero-trust enterprise security is also quickly becoming popular, with SARS-CoV-2 still running rampant, by letting users work remotely from any location on Earth. 
                All the while a hosting service is working behind-the-scenes to ensure proper credentials and security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the adaptation of 5g and the constant improvements in electronical manufacturing, <strong><em>ubiquitous computing</em></strong> (embedding computational capability into everyday objects) is not a far-fetched reality where any item can have computational power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud-based education platforms are also quickly gaining ground (another adaptation to SARS-CoV-2), and improvements in global connectivity will only push a <strong><em>globalized education</em></strong> that enables students of all socioeconomic status the same level and access of education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cloud has also become the best environment to develop <strong><em>AIs</em></strong>, where there is an abundance of processing power. But you can only learn so much from yourself, which is why <strong><em>Inference</em></strong> is also integral to creating an AI. 
                This is where our improvements in mobile devices and technology come in - creating a massive inference pool of data for AIs to take what it has learned from the cloud environment and try to apply it to individual use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of the above developments affect many fields from economics, education, and even our daily lives:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Ubiquitous computing:</em></strong> 
                    ubiquitous computing systems are used for the handling of data (collecting, processing, etc&hellip;) with the ability to adapt to the context and activity of said data. 
                    As we are prone to human errors in our decision-making processes, comprehensive data that is available in ubiquitous computing systems allows for better, more productive workflows and processes, 
                    ie. When collecting data on how much water is leaking from a city&rsquo;s water mains, a wireless sensor network can instantaneously relay this information without the need for manual intervention. 
                    Going along with the above example, the number of required water plant workers/maintenance crews may drastically decrease as engineers can easily determine how to adapt to the situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Globalized education:</em></strong> 
                    The globalization of education means the globalization of knowledge. 
                    Discussing the impact of this is akin to discussing the impact of globalization, which has been an ongoing debate ever since globalization was first conceptualized. 
                    In short, cultures around the world will become more democratic, creative and critical, developing interpersonal and prosocial capabilities first as the challenges of environmental sustainability and global development are highly complex and dynamic. 
                    To be more specific, among the first to be impacted will be traditional classroom educational institutions. As online learning becomes more prevalent, schools and its faculties may need to adapt and attract as many local families and students as possible to compete with the flexibility ease of access of online courses, 
                    or perhaps create their own online courses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>AIs:</em></strong> The advantage of running an AI locally, as opposed to on a server environment, is the preservation of user privacy &ndash; 
                    user data does not need to be submitted to the cloud for the AI to function, and increases relative speed of the AI&rsquo;s output. With every new flagship smartphone model, 
                    we see new advances and features built by AIs, taking full use of <strong><em>mobile inference</em></strong>, things like Apples&rsquo;s FaceID and Animoji, Google Assistant and Google Lens, 
                    and Seeing Eye by Microsoft all use AIs powered by mobile devices and cloud technology to push the boundaries of human-computer interactions: <em>Unlocking our devices with a simple glance; 
                    Real time image searches; Support people with visual impairments by providing image recognition features. </em>The effect of this will span across every mobile device user regardless of background and geographic location.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For IT students, there is, without a doubt, going to be a big impact caused by cloud technology on not just their academic progress, but also their eventual career path as well. 
                Cloud technology is already being implemented in many higher-education courses with tools like canvas, github, and google drive being essential to their learning processes. 
                Our daily lives are not without change either, as technology is slowly seeping into every aspect of life itself. 
                Things that we have been doing subconsciously have one way or another changed with the use of technological interconnectivity - 
                pictures that we take are then instantaneously synced and saved on a cloud, using our voice to command devices and control how they do things with voice recognition and cloud-located AIs, to cars having user profiles that access your favorite playlists and radio channels from a server. 
                And the people around us are subject to all of this as well, with their lives also slowly, but surely being brought into the cloud as it expands into every corner of human advancement: smart fridges, smart tvs, and even smart ovens all use, or is connected to, some iteration of internet connectivity and cloud-based technology.

            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong></li>
            <p>
                Machine learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been being recently some buzzwords to everyone around the world, not only about technology-related people for couple years such as self-driving vehicles or chess-playing computers. 
                Then what actually is machine learning? Machine learning is program or application that applied AI helps it automatically learn from experience and data then improve the systems itself. 
                Furthermore, it requires technical and complicated algorithms to program computers to work without explicitly programmed afterward. 
                After finishing programming, the applications will work on their own and learn data without interfered by human. 
                Today, most of technology devices are seeking to applied machine learning to be a part of them even on cleaning robots which have a very simple task. 
                To be clearer, the function helps the robots to learn and save the locations that have more dust or remember the construction of the house to avoid falling and hitting. 
                We may not notice but it has enhanced the devices significantly. Up to date, machine learning has been contributing to the world a huge innovation. 
                Some tech giants use machine learning to create their own personal assistants such as Siri from Apple, Alexa form Amazon and Google Assistant from Google, etc. 
                These personal assistants can talk to you naturally, help you to manage your work by remembering and reminding you appointment time, telling the weather, setting alarm, switching devices on and off. 
                Furthermore, machine learning is also applied on camera for many reasons from recognizing human faces to reducing crime. 
                For example, modern smartphone will unlock by owner&rsquo;s faces and it will learn new features every time the users unlock to increase the accuracy for the next time because their faces will definitely look different after makeup or putting on glasses. 
                The governments are able to track down criminals by using surveillances installed AI which will help police to follow people they want. 
                There is a social humanoid robot whose name is Sophia developed based on machine learning. Sophia can talk and act like normal human and she even receive an honor to become a citizen at Saudi Arabia. 
                There are a lot of things that machine learning can do and will do in the future. 
                Most manufacturers are focusing on creating products included AI and machine learning. 
                In the next few years, there are many fields that machine learning could be involved from business marketing to healthcare. 
                The function will automatically collect and sort the data, it also can figure out the most interesting product of business, so digital marketing will be the future marketing for all businesses. 
                Moreover, if it is successful in healthcare, there will be millions of lives saved due to illness and disease detection, and at some level the machine will reach the higher accuracy than human at some aspects. 
                Then language barriers will be not a big concern to everyone around the world thanks to machine learning, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
                It helps computers to understand paragraphs in some specific language with deeper meaning for better searching and translating. It will improve the quality of studying, travelling and entertaining because languages will be no longer a barrier to everyone. 
                One last thing that have been heating for a long time is self-driving car that the drivers do not drive anymore, the vehicle system will do instead by using computer vision to detect the road, lane, object around, space between others and GPS to locate the routes and destinations. 
                If self-driving vehicle could globalize, I think the accident rate will be reduced because the reaction of system and machine is always better than average human and speed limits will be controlled, human may fall asleep while driving but machine will never. 
                Machine learning is a part of a model of brain cell interaction created by Donald Hebb in 1949 and at that time the hardware is not good enough to run the program or to make it popular and possible like todays. 
                It requires a quality graphic card to run the complicated program and a huge storage because the processes need a lot of data to experience and learn. 
                Furthermore, some of advanced devices such modern camera with high resolution and megapixel or microphone which can eliminate noise and input valuable data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning will have a huge impact to human civilization in every aspect from single household such as cooking, cleaning equipment to stock market prediction or natural environment. 
                Specifically, in healthcare, a simple wearable sensor monitors everything from your activity such as pulse rate, steps walked, oxygen or even sugar level sleeping habits. 
                These data are significantly useful for doctor to track down diseases. 
                In business, machine learning and AI have successfully enhanced customer satisfaction. 
                According to Forbes,&rdquo;57% of enterprise executives believe that the most important growth benefit of AI and ML will be improving customer experiences and support&rdquo;. 
                Moreover, social media and shopping online sites analyze on buying and searching habits then use these data to attract buyers by advertisement or items that are fit their pocket. 
                With machine learning and AI, everybody around this world will be affected but at some rate. 
                Nowadays, this kind of technologies have been bringing many negative impacts to people who have manual works. 
                For instance, we will not need drivers or taxi drivers when there are self-driving cars or hire cleaners when there are many kinds of cleaning robots around us. 
                So that, people need to learn and interact with technologies more frequent and technology jobs, especially machine learning or AI developer will be highly demanded in from now to the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I apply to this IT program for many reasons and machine learning plays an important one because I realize that everything surrounding me are technologies and machine learning relation. 
                I chose this career because I do not want my future job will become old fashioned some and my position will be replaced by a machine. 
                With this program at RMIT, I think it will be a good chance for me to find job in the future. 
                Absolutely, I need not to housework daily in the future, there might be a virtual assistant that can help me manage my workload. 
                Everyone will change due to technology, our parents are a very practical example for that because I did not think that one day they will approach and use social media, even more active than me. 
                I think that not only me affected by machine learning, my parents are using it every day through their iPhone by unlocking it and more than me, they are the ones who need helps from machine to do daily work such as driving around, cleaning house, securing their home and carrying heavy belongings.

            <li><strong>Robots</strong></li>
            <p>Technology field intended for robots is approaching a new turning point through the developments of intricate mechanism structures with the objective to acquire demands of complicated tasks. Having well-rounded and intensive structures for robots inclines to accelerate the debate about what regulations contended to be ideally appropriate to set the foundation for the rise of robots. Deep into the modern history of robots, there had been a numerous of non-human workers which had mainly attributed their best performance to a little of hard work and simple logics, had sparked engineers, technology as a whole to found the majors of the robot industry. Prototypes of metallic robots which required cables made their appearance and vigorously tested by dedicated engineers after the vast majority of registrations to learn about the new accepted branch of technology. In 1950s, a boom in the basis of the modern robotics industry saw the community to announced the birth of &ldquo;The Unimate Puma'' &ndash; a machine that learn-&nbsp; proved how intelligence could be embedded within the robots and this were quoted as being vital for the generation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) [1]. It must be admitted, however, that typical images of machines in those days were machines that processed such basic jobs which lied into human capability range.</p>
            <p>The main question is how perfect can a single robot in the past perform today's tasks? Estimated that of all ten atemptions, eight out of ten are failures. This can be considered to be a limitation nowadays. Consequently, robot's awkwardness actions require the brain to have to spend extra time interpreting what robots are doing because their action is not suitable anymore in the new era. In concerning hours, finally, technicians learn and complement their information. One of the advice from a source clarified this proposition &ldquo;experience surge up when it comes to robot production requires versions, updates to serve the needs in time&rdquo;.&nbsp; What is more remarkable than the advice is the fact that existing updates for robots have proved its functionalities. It is the computer programme that makes the robots own its adequate capabilities and a human-like behaviour.Why is this kind of technology developed ? What is mentioned here is that the robot industry in general has many improvements by time. Including &ldquo;states of the art&rdquo; of robots is the reason why the robot industry grows.</p>
            <p>State of the art of robots would be shrouded in mystery without the uncovering of this survey problem. In a survey of more than 100 people, it was found that the discrepancy between a set of homeowners use cleaner robots and a set of homeowners cleaning their house manually is beyond imagination. 96% chose to use cleaner robots rather than working on their own.[2] The analysis sounds really straightforward until the percentage of other part being larger than 4% when there must be 100 people participating in the survey.&nbsp; In reality, in an interview of Niels Van Der Zell - boss of SoftBank Robotics cleaning robots- corrects&nbsp; the survey data. He points out &ldquo; cleaning robots is something that you and I obviously know. i cover it from a journalistic point of view and you develop it and within you know our sectors some people might know them but a lot of people in the wider market don't know about these robots existing&rdquo;. These statistics are keys that would grant &ldquo;states of the art&rdquo;&nbsp; for this technology. &ldquo;If robots are to clean our homes, they&rsquo;ll have to do it better than a person&rdquo;(James Dyson).</p>
            <p>Increasing people&rsquo;s benefits and work efficiency remain challenging in the world of robot production for the time being. Advanced mechanisms designed in a robot must guarantee its precision, stability and finally measurements. However at this point, building such gadgets within a robot is still truly daunting and likely to get error-prone. It goes without saying that it is bad enough that we don&rsquo;t even have a good recommendation for a robot we use in our home. Our choice of domestic robots has generally been substandard and expensive. And where other creative professions have industry standards, such as Beam System Remote Technology, the iPATROL RILEY, the Pepper, Walker, ect. Our industry standard is still the BOT RETAIL. The BOT RETAIL has its recognition, navigating systems define its state of the art. That is the robot will show goods to buy depending on the user's emotion, able to interact with people, make payments as well as deliver food. When a robot moves, a recognition system is called to recognise objects while the navigating system does the path finding job. In fact, what is interesting here is that it was not until days later that the systems were real flop and were removed to replace with simpler systems and the state of the art of this cutting edge paradigm was left imaginary.</p>
            <p>On the bright side, this opens the window of opportunity for the iRobot Roomba 690 &ndash; The cleaner robot- to go further. Early versions of Roomba received many criticisms, some highlighted the infamous performances of this robot such as &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t really clean carpets, at least not like a proper vacuum can&rdquo;(Liam McCable). The BOT RETAIL paradigm has turned into conventions for a newer design of Roomba. It is ironical to see the success compared to the BOT RETAIL allows Roomba to achieve its desirable properties. The simple model of Roomba can be described in a fews words. If you want to have your carpets cleaned then the brushes will work together to grab everything and clean the debris. If you want to find an item under the sofa then it will use an object detection system to take that out. And if you want Roomba to clean the mess in a chaotic space say you are cleaning your basement then it will plan in clutter and clean it right away. That&rsquo;s it and you now understand how Roomba functions.</p>
            <p>Besides Roomba, there exists a hundred different types of robots that play a magnificent role for humanity. One question bumps to our mind, is this all that humans can do? Since the movie &ldquo;ExMachina'' released and showed a scenario of a robotic world, the concept of&nbsp; &ldquo;robotic predictions&rdquo; has spread worldwidely. On the other hand, American scientists are having initial successes in the process of &ldquo;hybriding&rdquo; human and robot. In their researches, they implement with an eager to consolidate AI and the human brain together.&nbsp; The group had a breakthrough when they discovered a biological material which can be a link to actualize this task. [3] With improvements like that, AI have been&nbsp; devinized and predicted.</p>
            <p>To envision core advances in artificial intelligence in upcoming years we reference this idea. &ldquo;AI and robotics will be integrated into nearly every aspect of most people&rsquo;s daily lives&rdquo; (Aaron 2014). Citizens will be assisted by AI and will no longer spend time using their brains. Especially, decision or even mundane household activities might depend on AI and vice versa. Portable devices are main transportation in accomplishing best outcomes for a person, organizations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we might be ready for job losses scenario since a study has pictured robot&rsquo;s knowledge in an upcoming decade which should be beyond human capability.

            <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong></li>
            <p>In the digital era, transactions from almost all sectors and industries have gradually transformed to cyber infrastructure thanks to the increasing convenience, usage and trust of the Internet. However, the exposure of such information systems to cybercrime epidemic has put the cyber domain in vulnerable position of complex risk aggregation. As it is an intricate task to ensure cyber security, sophisticated architecture is required to tackle the risks and the intensity of their damage and to acquire the analytical capability of detecting threats. As a result, various machine learning algorithms have been created to provide mechanism that controls authentic access to a network and protects it from possible intruders and one common mechanism of which is by cryptography.</p>
            <p>The use of cryptographic technique is commonly through encryption to utilise security and privacy of information or data asset especially during the login process. However, a more efficient method should be in place when an existing web-based application that was already encrypted and is in need of being updated. The state of art of encryption technology is then showcased by the introduction of hash function which is a cryptographic primitive built with public-key system for security support such as non-reputation, message integrity and authentication. Contributing to the application of secret-key authentication codes, Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is the most known hash function. In order to achieve the mission of matching the security level of the algorithm with advanced encryption standard, variety of SHA versions have been announced in which SHA-512, a one-way hash function that receives messages as a form of input in any size and produces message digest with the length of 512 bits, is the most recent one. With message compression or summary function, SHA converts an entered variable length into a fixed-length binary sequence. This variable-to-fixed length scheme is studied and proved to provide robust and reliable security level to cyber assets, which is widely acknowledged for the implementation of Blockchain.</p>
            <p>Ensuring data security and integrity, Blockchain technology comprises immutable data records in a distributed network. These data ledger consists of transaction information stored in each node of the network and each data block is connected to the hash value of the previous one. The essential feature supporting the data integrity of this network is the ledger being updated by issuing consensus command to an existing consensus protocol like Proof of Property (PoP), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW), which generates sharing mode of a defined data block to every node in the distributed network. Blockchain embarks potential solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of data privacy, authorization and authentication, governance and address space. Since IoT technology emerges to extensive fields, the mentioned promising features enable Blockchain-based IoT networks to capture attention of researchers who are trying to implement this technology in their interest especially in industrial fields to boost productivity, reduce cost and enhance automatic operation.</p>
            <p>Tackling privacy and security challenges in IoT network, Blockchain is perceived as an emerging solution by storing data blocks to resource-constrained IoT devices. Several blockchain-based IoT techniques are proposed by the academics that are specifically focused on increasing cyber security. Taking an example from a smart city which is an application of IoT, a security framework is suggested to combat security threats by eliminating consensus for security, scalability and performance using a private blockchain. Additionally, a software-defined blockchain-based IoT architecture is also recommended with regards to treating blockchain as a service (BaaS) in which it is applied to push code as a virtual resource. The proposed blockchain architectural network is called DistBlockNet which is a SDN-based blockchain and IoT network, and is designed specifically for efficiency, scalability and security.</p>
            <p>The developmental achievements above benefit almost all fields that rely on technologies for productive operation processes. Exemplifying the healthcare industry, confidentiality and security concerns are alarming as electrical health records (EHR) are being implemented to digitally store patients&rsquo; medical records and to eliminate manual handling of such confidential information, from which two categories of issues are resulted. Dissent releases from either systemic flow of medical data from healthcare organizational system throughout to related industries or individual organization are concerned. These releases are conducted by authorised users that accidentally or intentionally leak medical data in violation of healthcare ethics and policies or by outsiders that breaks into the cyber system for release of the wanted information.&nbsp; In addition to the first category, systemic concerns are the other one referring to misconduct of parties that have access to the open disclosure of medical data and act against of the specific patients&rsquo; interests, which is otherwise considered as invading one&rsquo;s privacy. In short, the privacy issues arise from information flows and shares between and among secondary users, data buyers, and providers, with or without consent of the actual patients. In order to solve the discussed challenges, several blockchain-based applications in healthcare sector are proposed to make most of the key features of this technology. Applying blockchain to this domain to fix cyber security concerns has brought out positive changes and success as it offers tremendous advantages such as secure health records being accessible to authorised healthcare stakeholders, continuous and transparent accessibility to information, data pedigree, persistence of clinical data and lastly decentralization. On the other hand, this technology has its negative impact as to the limitations are also identified which are scalability of analysing possibilities of cyber threats and speed. It is necessary to discuss both positive and negative impact of blockchain-based EHR as it is critical for this particular sector to securely store and reasonably issue their medical records. Further solutions for this problem are presented to store sensitive information off-chain, to encrypt them to secure confidentiality and to apply Virtual Private Network to prevent cybercrimes.</p>
            <p>At the time of writing, we are experiencing so far the worst pandemic of the century which is the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependency on digital infrastructure skyrockets as per the need of staying connected during self-quarantine period. Cyber security is of greater significance since this environment is just suitable for cybercrimes to bombard. The massive reliance on virtual connectivity results in risker behaviors when dealing with sophisticated online scams especially for those who only use technology at bare minimum but are suddenly forced to reach &lsquo;tech savvy&rsquo; level. Misinformation is the so-called enemy to the online society during COVID-19 as cyber criminals take advantage of the curious nature of our psyche and spread false information about the coronavirus at our expense. A family member of mine was recently a victim of phishing when he received a text message on Facebook asking for his personal details in return for a &lsquo;fund&rsquo; that would help &lsquo;the family&rsquo; cope with this pandemic. These are the same people who should stay safe and conscious on all digital platforms as cybercrimes increase intensively. Organizations utilize technology to its finest but there are still people who only just embrace social network since this pandemic. Cyber security should be addressed and educated on a continuous basis. Investments on cyber security education should be in place as the workforce is behind their home router instead of the organizational firewalls with limited security. Debates around cyber security emphasise its importance on our daily operation so besides mastering the technology alone, raising awareness about cyber safety to our virtual circles in an effort for them to protect themselves is as important.</p>
