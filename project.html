        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>
            Taking into consideration a few similarities between Dung&rsquo;s FaceX project and Khoi&rsquo;s animal translation app project, 
            we have decided on a diagnostics software for dogs and cats purely for clinical purposes (CatCare). 
            This app will be able to some of the things Khoi&rsquo;s project is capable of doing &ndash; like recording dogs and cats and giving out a text-description of what the animal is feeling, 
            and a behavioral recognition feature to translate the body language of the target dog or cat (Ear positions, pupil dilation, stance, tail behavior, etc.) using sensors and cameras. 
            And the ability for the user to input the most obvious symptoms the animal is exhibiting like body temperature, physical swelling, bleeding/wounds, blood in stool/urine, vomiting, etc. 
            and returning all possible afflictions the animal might be going through.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The purpose of this tool is to aid veterinarians in diagnosing and treating dogs and cats that are ill. 
            Animal care is one of the most difficult parts of animal communication, and any tool capable of lightening this burden on medical professionals will only further animal healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool can be ran using smartphones, or a computer with an internet connection hooked up to cameras and sensors. 
            An animal is to be placed where the sensors and cameras are set up, and users can choose from a variety of options of what they want the application to do: take pictures/record the animal from multiple angles to detect physical anomalies or give a text description of what the animal is feeling 
            (distress, fear, in pain, etc.), or simply input a number of symptoms from preliminary diagnosis and the application will give out what is most likely wrong with the animal &ndash; 
            this will be done using an AI algorithm trained to diagnose using a data set of symptoms and its correlating illnesses to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine likely illnesses</li>
            <li>Percentage of how likely the animal is to have said illness.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The program can return multiple results and the percentage of likelihood for those results. 
            The goal is not to replace medical professionals or pinpoint the correct affliction, 
            but to simply aid doctors in narrowing down the possibilities and speed up diagnosis as well as treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The product will host an AI algorithm on a cloud, using any relevant animal medical knowledge that is available as inference. 
            On the user side, at least 1 camera is required for the recording/recognition feature to function, preferably 2 
            (One to capture the front and one for the back side of the animal). 
            If camera access is unavailable, the diagnostic feature will still function as long as there is an internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            One hurdle we need to overcome for the product to be successful will be designing an interface that is easy enough to learn that barely any training is required. 
            Doctors already have a lot on their plate, and the added pressure of having to learn a specialized tool, especially for older practitioners who are not as tech-savvy, 
            can be discouraging so ease of use is paramount. 
            This is not easily achieved as a core feature of the application requires the mounting and setup of digital cameras/sensors. 
            A remedy for this is to turn our product into a live-service (subscription model) &ndash; 
            for a monthly fee, we can provide the clinic with all the hardware/facilities needed for the product to be fully functional and perhaps even training on how to use the program effectively. 
            Among other things, the realization of the AI algorithm can also be difficult as there has not been a commercially viable application, 
            teaching an AI to diagnose illnesses is one thing (Whyte C. 2019), but to make it cost effective is another. 
            Some physicians might also be very unreceptive of this product, believing that the program seek to replace human doctors altogether. 
            This is somewhat a baseless fear, as the medical records needed as inference for the AI still need to be created by trained professionals along with their knowledge being extremely important to the diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the product/service is successful, not only will animal healthcare improve drastically and help reduce animal euthanizations, but human healthcare will likely shift drastically as well &ndash; 
            the medical field is almost, if not always, short on staff, whether it be doctors or nurses, giving physicians massive workloads (average of 80 patients a day). 
            Even if CatCare only applies to dogs and cats, it is only a matter of time until this technology can be applied to humans and thus, 
            giving physicians the much-needed help to lessen their workloads and create an easier barrier of entry for people pursuing the medical profession.
